    "### Why Chicago Crime?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are already quite a few articles on the crime rates in different neighborhoods, but few of these break it down into districts. Also, a lot of rankings are based on the most recent crime rates, but our goal is to find the districts where the decrease in crime is the largest. That way, we can hopefully try to predict that a district will become more safe in the time a person lives there. This is important for people trying to move to start a family. If you are trying to raise a family in a neighborhood, you want to know that the danger in that area is decreasing as well as which ones are safer. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will be helpful to families who may not be able to afford the 'nice' districts in Chicago. The reasoning behind this is that 'nice', wealthy districts will always be relatively safe. However, for people who can't afford to live in these areas, it might be more important for them to know that their neighborhood is getting safer with each passing year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the reason we think that the smaller numbered districts will have a higher crime rate is because, looking at a map, these areas are the older areas of chicago near the water where the infrastructure is not as new and the population density is higher.\n",
