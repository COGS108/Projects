    "My research Question is that: San Diego has a poor public transportation that leads to a low flow rate of the park, especially among students. In particular, most students need parents to send off and pick up when they go to the park for recreations. To address this issue, I suggest that the city should spend money on projecting a metro line for these students to increase the flow rate of the park."

    "This project focuses on how to let young people to involve in more outdoor activities. The author mentions the point that lack of transportation is one of the primary reasons for the issue. It is similar to my proposal, which focuses on the poor public transportation that cause less students going to the park. This project also supported my proposed solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the prior research on the question, it demonstrate that to gain insight into the top barriers for youth toget outdoors and be more active. We need to solve the problem of poor parental influence and the lack of transportation. Moreover, we need to adequately educating parents; and integrating the outdoors activities with more convenient public transportation to parks & Recreation in San Diego.\n",

    "The prior work shows that we may solve the question by providing accessible and affordable transportation for young people to parks & Recreation.\n",

    "*The main issue in California is its inconvenience and poor public transfortation, which holds back many students who want to spend their leisure time in the park. If we provide more convenient transportations, such as a metro line, to students who does not have the ability to transport to the park by themselves, they will choose to go to the park more often for recreations. Thus, this suggestion will attract more young people to the park for outdoor activities and therefore increase the flow rate of the park.*\n"
