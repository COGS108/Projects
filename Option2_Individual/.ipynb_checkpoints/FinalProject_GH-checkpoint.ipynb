    "In this study, I will look into what kind of public space in terms of parks or recreational facilities does the people of San Diego like more and use more to better inform the Parks and Rec department of San Diego of the public’s preferences. This analysis will be done with data collected from Yelp. Through analysis of Yelp data, I concluded that there is no statistically significant difference between the sentiment toward the parks and recreational facilities of San Diego and their ratings. However, many of the reviews are for parks and could indicate that people may use parks more than recreational centers. "

    "To better inform the park and recreation department of San Diego I want to look into what kinds of parks do people prefer. Do people want parks with more nature and green spaces or do they want parks that are more like activity centers? For me this comes down to does the person prefers to have a more active lifestyle or a more relaxed way of life. The appeal of a recreational center with ball courts and playgrounds promotes a more active lifestyle while also being able to provide spaces for social activities. It is much easier for people to exercise at a recreational center because they don’t need to worry about the immense cost of fitness equipment or gym membership. Having ball courts also garner interactions between members of the community as they get to participate in team sports which enforces a sense of community. On the other hand, a park with more greenery and nature allows a space for people to relax and enjoy nature while still being close to their neighborhood and therefore more accessible. While does not provide people with room to play some sports, it still allows for other sports that have fewer equipment needs like a game of frisbee tag. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my research, I found that San Diego has about 400+ regional and open space parks, 57 recreational centers, 13 pools, and 7 skate parks. Showing that there are significantly more parks than parks that are more activity-centric. I also want to know how these public spaces influence our daily lives and the community. I found that nature has a lot of benefits to our physical and emotional health. In a Times article, it said that \"nature can provide stress relief, increase social interaction, encourage physical exercise, and even help soothe mental illness.\" Meaning that green spaces in our parks can allow people to interact more with nature and thereby help them release some stress from their everyday urban life. Not only does nature parks benefit our health, but it also helps with increasing the health of the community spaces. In an article from climateforhealth.org, it states that \"Green infrastructure is the natural and built green spaces that use nature and natural processes to manage a variety of challenges, including water quality, flood risk, and air quality and temperature, which in turn can improve human health.\" This means that greener park helps improve the health of the environment, the community, and our health. These articles provide strong cases for parks with more green spaces and thus we need to put to understand what public opinion lies, what kinds of parks they like and therefore use, and what policymakers should do to promote personal and community health through parks. \n",

    "There should not be any ethical issues with this data analysis method as all responses have no names attached to them and it is just their views on the park. The dataset I receive to complete this assignment is already been processed to remove all personally identifiable information so privacy can be guaranteed. I do not foresee there are any ethical concerns about the usage of the data generated from my project as it is just a representation of people’s opinions that they choose to make public. They are only informative data that the city can use to better serve the community. "

    "From the sentimental analysis, the reviews for the parks and recreation center in San Diego are both positive. However, the reviews are more positive for recreation centers than the parks as seen in higher average rating for recreational centers at 4.06 compares to 4.02. And also, the sentiment value for reviews of recreation centers is higher at 0.51 than the sentiment value for reviews of parks at 0.48. Although, with further analysis and running a t-test on the two values, there is no statistical significance to the difference between the average ratings and the average sentiment of the reviews (p-value of 0.84 and 0.73 respectively). I do have to mention that this analysis has some shortcomings which are that there are many more reviews for parks than there are for recreational centers. There are also many more parks than recreational centers in San Diego and the dataset. This means that our sample size of reviews for recreation centers is lacking and the data generated may not be as conclusive and generalizable. This could also mean that people prefer to go to parks than to recreational centers since there are much more reviews for parks than recreational centers. There could also be a confounding variable created by the source of the dataset as in this is a voluntary response, the sample could have biases where more strong negative or more strong positive reviews outnumber the more neutral reviews as people with those opinions are less likely to write a review. Also, Yelp reviews include visitors and locals so this may bias parks as those are more generally where visitors go. In conclusion, there are no statistically significant data to show a preference toward parks or recreational centers meaning both types of public spaces are valued by the public and the hypothesis is disproven. Further research is needed to be done on the usage of each public facility to better understand how the public utilizes these resources. "
