    "In a 2-year study where they explored the outcomes of health inspections in relation to restaurant inspection frequency and neighborhood sociodemographic, chain restaurants were found to have significantly fewer violations per inspection (1). Chain restaurants serve less perishable food so the chance of foodborne illnesses were less likely. Also, the number of total violations per inspection was not associated with any block group sociodemographic characteristics. However, it was also noted that “the number of foodborne-illness risk factor violations per inspection was significantly associated with the proportion of black residents, whereas the number of good retail practice violations per inspection was significantly positively associated with proportion of black residents and hispanics.” The takeaway message of this study was that it doesn’t matter if a restaurant is non-chain or chain; health inspections should be done in a way that focuses more on restaurants in areas that seem to be in higher risk to reduce frequency of violations. \n",
