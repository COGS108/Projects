    "Today, business reviews, ratings, and grades are the decision making for any business to measure for their quality, popularity, and future success. For restaurants business, ratings, hygienic, and cleanliness are essential. One popular site for reviews is known as Yelp, offers many individual ratings for restaurants and each state's Department of Health conducts restaurant inspections annually. I want to conduct an experiment to see if there is any correlation between Yelp ratings and inspection scores, both conducted by different parties and different scoring methods. I have concluded that yelp ratings and inspection scores do not have direct correlation. Restaurants can maintain a high level of cleanliness and hygienic food conditions (good inspection score), but fail to get good ratings, which can be due to bad service or less than tasty food."

    "As a customer, you have no way of knowing how closely a restaurant follows health/food guidelines about temperature, cross-contamination, and basic sanitation. So you rely on Yelp reviews and the restaurant's health inspection score.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an \"A\" grade tells you that the place is clean is careful about food safety issues. Similarly, a five-star yelp review can also inform you that the restaurant's service and food is excellent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp reviews are more up-to-date (since they are updated almost everyday) and are reflection of people's experiences at the restaurant. Customers often write about the cleanliness of the restaurant, the service they received, and the quality of the food. Furthermore, there was a study that focused on the effect of Yelp scores on a restaurant. \n",
    "\n",
    "There was a study that focused on how much do Yelp scores affect a restaurant.\n",
    "- This study found that: \n",
    "        (1) a one-star increase in Yelp rating leads to a 5-9 percent increase in revenue; \n",
    "        (2) ratings do not affect restaurants with chain affiliation; \n",
    "        (3) chain restaurants have declined in market share as Yelp pentration have increased; \n",
    "        (4) consumer response to a restaurant's average rating is affected by the number of reviews and whether the reviewers are certified as \"elite\" by Yelp.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an other study that took NYC restaurant reviews and inspection scores data to find out if there is any correlation between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study found that:\n",
    "- The study used a scatter plot that shows the relationship between inspection score and rating. It indicated that there is no direct clear correlation between the two variables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- It is fairly common for a restaurant with a C grade inspection score to acheive a 4-5 star ratings in a review. This could be because as long as the food is tasty, people will rate the restaurant well because they are not and do not pay attention to cleanliness and hygienic issues (what a health inspector pays attention to because it's their job).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, my hypothesis is that there is a correlation between restaurant reviews and inspection scores. And how the location of the city leads to more reviews being written and frequent visits from the health inspector, thus affecting the restaurant as a whole.\n",

    "I hypothesize that location does play a factor in restaurants' Yelp reviews and inspection scores because New York City is more heavily populated than North Carolina, thus resulting in greater amount of people eating out and writing reviews. Also with larger population, sanitation and hygiene is important, which results in frequent health inspections. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I believe there is a correlation between Yelp reviews and inspection scores. Restaurant hygiene/inspection scores are already publicly available on the internet, however hygiene scores vary by city. \n",
    "\n",
    "So I presume, that negative yelp reviews can result in lower inspection scores and lower inspcetion scores will result in negative yelp reviews."

    "There are some issues with biases in the yelp data. The yelp data does not provide specific reasoning as to why those specific restaurants got their respective ratings. In addition, we do not know who made those reviews. Though this is good for privacy reasons. The individuals who rated the restaurants are not exposed and won't be targeted if they gave low ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the is done by people who biases and also uses data, which have biases. The inspections conducted by health inspectors also carry biases. For example, if a health inspector have a grudge against a specific cuisine, they might be likely to pick out flaws and faults and give that restaurant a terrible health score, which can affect the business as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also different cities have different health inspection policies. For example, New York City restaurants has more frequent visits from health inspectors due to the city being heavily populated and with more a larger population, there are higher chances of contamination and food-borne outbreaks. On the otherhand, North Carolina restaurants have fever visits from health inspectors, and that could be because of their state health policies as well as having a smaller population than New York City.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who are the stakeholders affected by my experiment? In my experiment, the data provided is made public and I am using the data that is public and shaping it to prove my hypothesis. It is not my intention to defame any restaurants or any specific health inspector.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of data, I only have data from North Carolina, and I collected background information of restaurants and health policies for New York City. The health inspections data can be bias because first, the data is created by humans and sometimes, the state does not want to ruin their name and thus only show to the public restaurants that have small-scaled violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I cannot guarantee full privacy, because these data can be found on health inspection websites and Yelp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the inspection score and yelp reivew does not entirely define the sucess of a restaurant. Instead it only displays their flaws and areas that need improvement, not areas where they are doing well."

    "In conclusion, yelp ratings and health inspection scores are not correlated. Before my experiment, I presumed that lower yelp ratings would result in lower health inspection scores, and vice versa. However that is not the case. It is common for a restaurant with a C grade inspection score to acheive a 4-5 star ratings in a yelp review. Even with a low inspection score, the restaurant's business is not entirely affected and the restaurant can still have a high yelp review rating. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some limitations that I faced during this project and experiment is that the data was limited in that I had a difficult time comparing two varibales statisically because there was very little numeric values. I was able to generate numeric values from the data and have found that inspection score and yelp ratings are not correlated. Another limitation I encountered has to be the duplicate information in the datasets. I found it difficult to have to filter through the rows/columns to get rid of duplicates. Also, not all the columns were filled in, meaning that some data was missing for some restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, I do not evaluate this as a successful project, but I do think there are some small accomplishements, such as being able to see how location does affect the amount of reviews generated for a restaurant, how low yelp reviews doesn't mean a restaurant is terrible, or how a low inspection score doesn't define the sucess of a restaurant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some covariates I wish to measure is what the yelp reviews/ratings were during the time of the restaurant's health inspection. The current ratings are a general rating of the restaurant without acknowledging when in the timeline the rating was given. The health inspections scores data have the date when the inspection was performed except does not help in that there were no past or future inspections.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the future, I can do further analysis on analyzing review comments and try to find why some restaurants have good reviews but low inspection scores and vice versa."
