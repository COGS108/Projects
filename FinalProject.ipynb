    "There exist potential biases in the observations put forth in the dataset. Potential biases may include families who come from wealthy areas in California such as many places in the Silicon Valley or well off areas in the Los Angeles/San Diego counties. These families that come from these areas may be used to abnormally high house/apartment prices due to potential safety/better quality of life from living in these communities. Schools also play a large part of housing prices since areas with renowned schools generally boast much higher house prices compared to other places that might give out more land for less of a price. However, there might be a risk of missing out on residents since the collection of data is done on a block group basis. The definition of a block group is given in the “Data” section of the proposal. \n"
