    "Medicare is a national health insurance program that covers health care costs for adults over the age of 65 and younger people with specific disabilities. Medicare has four parts that help cover certain services such as Hospital Insurance, Medical Insurance, prescription drug coverage and a Medicare Advantage which is an all in one plan. The main benefit of Medicare is that it provides health coverage regardless of the person’s income, thus benefiting people with low income by helping those who are unable to afford medical insurance (“Acute Inpatient PPS”, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "But unfortunately this isn’t always the case. Studies such as ‘Medicare Utilization in the United States: PSRO and Regional Impacts’ by DL Rothberg, J Pinto and PM Gertman show how geographical factors affect medicare in the United States. Factors such as demographic and socio-economics play a role in determining the amount of medicare one receives. In this project we explore how population plays a role in determining the amount of medicare one receives. \n",

In the columns of the dataset, it involves DRG to classify the system grouping similar clinical conditions and procedures and the provider city.
