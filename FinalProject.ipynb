    "Medicare is a national health insurance program that covers health care costs for adults over the age of 65 and younger people with specific disabilities. Medicare has four parts that help cover certain services such as Hospital Insurance, Medical Insurance, prescription drug coverage and a Medicare Advantage which is an all in one plan. The main benefit of Medicare is that it provides health coverage regardless of the person’s income, thus benefiting people with low income by helping those who are unable to afford medical insurance (“Acute Inpatient PPS”, 2019).\n",

    "But unfortunately this isn’t always the case. Studies such as ‘Medicare Utilization in the United States: PSRO and Regional Impacts’ by DL Rothberg, J Pinto and PM Gertman show how geographical factors affect medicare in the United States. Factors such as demographic and socio-economics play a role in determining the amount of medicare one receives. In this project we explore how population plays a role in determining the amount of medicare one receives. \n",

The Inpatient Prospective Payment System(MIPPS) is a payment system for inpatient care and stays covered by medical insurance (Medicare). The data table includes Total Discharges, Average Covered Discharges, Average Total Payments, and Average Medicare Payments which help extract the amount of Medicare provided for a specific illness. what's more, the data set provides over 3,000 u.s hospitals spefical charges information, and top 100 most frequently billed discharges involving with the MIPPS payments. In the columns of the dataset, it involves DRG to represents over \"7 million discharges or 60 percent of totalMedicare IPPS discharges\". It classifies the system grouping similar clinical conditions and procedures and the provider city.

The patients’ data is kept anonymous.\n",

    "The privacy concerns are related to the patients' information in the first data. It may have the potential bias when the data information are classified by diseases: the developers of dataset or we may involve with the personal feeling, which can cause the unfair outcome. However, overall, I think this dataset should be a fine for us to apply in those follwoing reasons. From our prespective, as we mentioned previsouly, the recognizable personal informaiton is anonymous. It means that althought we are able to access the disease and payment details, we can't identify the person. Hence, it would not lead to the issues of　invasion privacy. We would able to deal with the dataset without bias. First data set  \"Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Provider\" is provided by the website called 'Data.Cvs.gov':'A federal government website managed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services'. In this case, the data and information are collected by the perfessonal government center, which shows certain reliability and trustworty of the information sources. It should be past through in the legit way.  Hence, the data could be served in education purpose and to inform the public. Given on that situation, I think the first dataset would allow us to apply those data information with equitable analysis. \n",

Hence, it would allow us to deeply analyze and respect the datas collected by each states' governments. It didn't target to any specific class, race or gender. Indeed, there are still potential biases: in this case, we can't guarantee that each state government would report the accurate data, when it comes with the change of population. The accuracy of postestimate population could be affected by the serveral factors: such as the undocumented people or human trafficking etc. This may lead to the potential biases because the dataset of popluation can't and didn't include these marginalized groups of people into considerations. Hence, the dataset of population change may fully reflect the real world situtaion in each states. These issues are out of our capability to handle and can't solved by us; Therefore, we acknownledge thess potential biases in the Ethics & Privacy section to present our thinking and concerns to these groups of people.\n",
