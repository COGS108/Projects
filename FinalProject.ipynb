    "    Nowadays when there is a huge variety of applications, the competition inside this market is extremely high. Every application that wants to be successful has to utilize all available data in order to improve its quality and avoid possible incorrect decisions. Correct analysis of different phenomena related to applications and discovering any hidden patterns inside the relevant data are essential in helping applications achieve these goals. Therefore, our team came up to the idea that an applications name could be an influential indicator of an application’s success."

Most of these variables have been preprocessed already, such as the translated review and sentiment. Many observations in this file (or the reviews), are for the same app. As for the second file, there are around 10.8k observations with 13 variables. The variables include app name, category of the app, the overall user rating, number of reviews, size of the app, number of installs, whether the app is paid or free, the price of the app, the content rating, the genres, when the data was last updated, the current version of the app available on the app store, and the minimum required Android version for the app. With these different features of the app, we will be able to ask our main question, which centers around the popularity of an app, and what makes it popular. Using the sentiment analysis on the reviews and analysis on the title (popular keywords in titles, length of the titles), we can determine factors other than the rating or number of installs to determine an app's popularity."
