- [ ] Make sure what you're measuring (variables) to answer the question is clear

**Background & Prior Work**:
- [ ] Include a general introduction to your topic
- [ ] Include explanation of what work has been done previously
- [ ] Include citations or links to previous work

- [ ] Appropriate analysis performed 
- [ ] Output of analysis interpreted and interpretation included in notebook

### Privacy/Ethics Considerations:
- [ ] Thoughtful discussion of ethical concerns included
- [ ] Ethical concerns consider the whole data science process (question asked, data collected, data being used, the bias in data, analysis, post-analysis, etc.)
- [ ] How your group handled bias/ethical concerns clearly described

### Conclusion & Discussion:
- [ ] Clear conclusion (answer to the question being asked) and discussion of results

- [ ] Clear explanations throughout
- [ ] Take home message clear

### Final Checks:
- [ ] Edit all text for clarity
- [ ] Remove all instructions
- [ ] Be sure text included throughout to guide reader
- [ ] Check to make sure all text and images are visible
- [ ] Names included
- [ ] Renamed file : `FinalProject_groupXXX-Fa22.ipynb`, where 'XXX' is replaced by your group's group number

### After the course is done:
- If you checked YES to make project public: the final project notebook (and only that!) will be placed in a repo with the rest of this quarters public reports. This helps future students by providing examples!
- Your projct repo will remain available to you in the near future. We cannot guarentee that will always be the case. That repo will never be public.
- If you would like your own copy of the entire repo you should follow these instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository Once you have done that it is yours forever. You will also be able to control access to the mirror (make it public or private as you would prefer)
